Welcome to my corner of the internet. I wanted a place to hold my ramblings, so I built an online junk drawer. 

Here you can find:
1. My review of gluten free establishments in NYC and beyond
2. My archived substack posts from my Food Fellowship year
3. Instructions for the Meredith TryAthlon, including historical stats and past photos
4. Side projects I've worked on, such as my turkey trot analytics dashboard, NCAA March Madness bracket predictor, etc...
5. An online gallery of MoMA exhibitions (Museum of Marshall Art)

Like any good cabinet of curiosities, new items are always being added.
