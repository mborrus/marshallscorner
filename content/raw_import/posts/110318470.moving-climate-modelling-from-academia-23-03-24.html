<p>After graduating college, I was interested in putting my physics and geoscience degree to good use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Climate science and modeling looked, to me, to be an incredibly prolific data-creating machine </strong>with academics as the only end-user. I wanted to see who in the “real world” was using this data, and that led me to discover <em><strong>Climate Analytics</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href="https://agfundernews.com/is-climate-modeling-as-a-service-the-next-frontier-of-risk-management-uk-startup-cervest-says-yes.html">Climate Modeling-as-a-Service</a>”, “ESG Analytics”, “<a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/business/startup-measures-the-risk-climate-change-poses-to-real-estate/article/555661">Risk Modeling</a>”. A result of nascency, this field covers a lot and there are not many defined boundaries, as I found when I first start looking into them. I’m hoping this map will be a resource for others trying to <strong>figure out the different niches and major players in the field</strong>. I’m approaching this through the eyes of an interested student of climate science as well as a part-time impact VC, and hoping this will give myself a better view of the field writ large.&nbsp;</p><p>I was inspired/motivated by <a href="https://medium.com/u/3f37cd63a560">Pietro Invernizzi</a>’s mapping of <a href="https://pinver.medium.com/a-new-breed-of-founders-using-data-to-help-the-planet-and-their-backers-f59537304353">Climate Tech Software</a> and have used his format to structure my own effort. To repurpose his disclaimer:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>“Note</strong>: This post’s definition of [Climate Analytics] is limited to companies using software and data to [quantify] Climate Change. In a future post, it could also include other areas like [emissions tracking and carbon credit marketplaces]. Many of the startups listed sit across multiple categories. I chose one for each, for simplicity. This is not an attempt at including every single company in these categories — many companies are missing — but rather a selection of the independent, private, and usually venture-backed ones I know and find interesting.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;width&quot;:null,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VKS1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff66e484b-67f4-4bbb-b999-2f0741785558_800x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div>
