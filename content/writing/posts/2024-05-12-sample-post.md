This is a sample post to demonstrate how the writing section works.

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists like this one
- [Links to other pages](/writing)

### Code

Inline `code` looks like this.

> Blockquotes work too. They're styled with a left border and light background.

## Images

If you have images, place them in `content/writing/assets/` and reference them with relative paths like:

```markdown
![Alt text](../assets/my-image.png)
```

That's the basics. Delete this sample post when you add real content.
